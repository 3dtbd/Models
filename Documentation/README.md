# Open Source Models for Unity 3D

This is a library of open source assets that you can use in early prototypes of your games and assets. They are all under a license that means you can use them in any environment and without restriction. This includes redistribution as individual assets. This means you can use them in demo scenes for your assets - something that is normally prohibitted. All you are required to do is provide a LICENSE and a NOTICE file in your project source.

The goal of this project is not to provide AAA quality assets but instead provide a library of assets that are "good enough" for game prototypes and demo scenes for your own published assets. Though you will be surprised at the quality of some of the models here.

# Use

  1. Open the `OpenSourceModels/Scenes/ModelsCatalog` scene
  2. Use the UI to filter the available models and select one for display
  3. When you find a model you like it will have been pinged in the Project view - go ahead and use it in your project as you would use any other model - but without license restrictions (see `NOTICE File` below)

# Contribution

We welcome contributions of new models and integrations of these models into other assets.
